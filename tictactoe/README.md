## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

This was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using a OOP programming paradigm.

## Optimizations

If I had more time I would optimise this program so that it can run as a single player game. To do this I would introduce a class extension which would include a method which would add an AI O or X to a random unassigned score (array) element, and have a conditional which would promt the AI to comeplete their line, or block the opponents line if they already had 2 in a row.

## Lessons Learned:

Using OOP was a major learning point for me, and the benefits and advantages that it can bring were clear. Having the ability to add features with the other functions abstracted resulted in an organised programming experience.
